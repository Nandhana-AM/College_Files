// 2. Given two strings of lowercase alphabets and a value k, the task is to find if two strings are Kanagrams of each other or not.
// Write a java program to find if two strings are kanagrams or not. 
//Note :Two strings are called k-anagrams if following two condi∆üons are true. 
//Both have same number of characters. Two strings can become anagram by changing at most k characters in a string.
